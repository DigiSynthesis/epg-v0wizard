# Supabase Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase for the IPTV Playlist Manager.

## 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: `iptv-playlist-manager`
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for the project to be ready (2-3 minutes)

## 2. Get Project Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** > **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
   - **anon public** key (starts with `eyJ`)

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## 4. Create Database Schema

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy and paste the contents of `lib/database.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

This will create:
- `profiles` table for user data
- `epg_files` table for EPG file metadata
- Row Level Security policies
- Automatic profile creation trigger

## 5. Set Up Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "New bucket"
3. Enter bucket details:
   - **Name**: `epg-playlists`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ… Enabled
4. Click "Create bucket"

### Configure Storage Policies

1. Click on the `epg-playlists` bucket
2. Go to **Policies** tab
3. Click "New policy" and add these policies:

**Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'epg-playlists' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

**Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to update their files**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'epg-playlists' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

**Policy 3: Allow public read access**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public downloads" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'epg-playlists');
```

## 6. Configure Authentication

1. Go to **Authentication** > **Settings**
2. Under **Auth Providers**, ensure **Email** is enabled
3. **Optional**: Disable email confirmation for easier testing:
   - Scroll to **Email Auth**
   - Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"
4. **Optional**: Configure custom SMTP settings for production

## 7. Test the Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try signing up with a test email
3. Check that:
   - User appears in **Authentication** > **Users**
   - Profile is created in **Database** > **profiles** table
   - You can upload EPG files and they appear in storage

## 8. Production Considerations

### Security
- Enable email confirmation in production
- Set up custom SMTP for reliable email delivery
- Review and tighten RLS policies if needed
- Enable 2FA for your Supabase account

### Performance
- Consider enabling database extensions if needed
- Monitor usage in the dashboard
- Set up database backups

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for high usage
- Monitor error logs
- Track authentication metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Environment variables not working:**
- Ensure `.env.local` is in project root
- Restart development server after adding variables
- Check variable names start with `VITE_`

**Storage upload fails:**
- Verify bucket is public
- Check storage policies are correctly set
- Ensure user is authenticated

**Database connection issues:**
- Verify project URL and anon key are correct
- Check if project is paused (free tier limitation)
- Review RLS policies

**Authentication not working:**
- Check email provider settings
- Verify redirect URLs in auth settings
- Review browser console for errors
